# Next.js 15 Intermittent Runtime Errors

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in a Next.js 15 application. The application intermittently throws runtime errors during development, seemingly related to the new App Router and Server Components features.  The errors are not consistently reproducible, making debugging challenging.

## Reproducing the Issue

Steps to reproduce the issue are not consistently reliable, but generally involve navigating pages rapidly or making frequent changes to the application code, restarting the development server multiple times etc. 

## Potential Causes

Possible causes may include:

* **Race conditions:** Asynchronous operations within the App Router or Server Components may be encountering race conditions leading to unpredictable behavior.
* **Caching issues:**  Aggressive caching mechanisms might be causing stale data or conflicting states.
* **Incomplete feature implementation:**  Some new feature implementation may still be in progress and undergoing final touches.

## Workarounds

While a definitive solution is still under investigation, consider the following possible workarounds if you encounter similar issues:

* **Restart the development server:**  Frequently restarting the development server can resolve issues, though this is only a temporary fix.
* **Simplify the application:** Attempt to isolate sections of the code to determine if specific functionalities trigger the problem.
* **Check Next.js updates:** The error may be resolved in newer versions of Next.js. Consider upgrading to the latest stable release.

## Note:

This issue is under investigation, and a more detailed explanation will be provided once a root cause is identified and verified.
